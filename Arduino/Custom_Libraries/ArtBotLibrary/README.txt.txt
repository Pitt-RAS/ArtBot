First time setup, jump to step 3.

Step 1: Open your Arduino library folder 
	By default (windows) located at: C:/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Documents/Arduino/libraries

Step 2: In this folder, delete the entire ArtBot folder

Step 3: Open the Arduino IDE
	On windows, type Arduino into the search bar

Step 4: Using the top menu, go to Sketch/Include Library/Add .zip library
	This should open a new file manager window

Step 5: Navigate to the ArtBot library (where this file is located)
	Default on windows: C:/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Documents/GitHub/ArtBot/Arduino/Custom_Libraries/ArtBotLibrary

Step 6: Double click on ArtBot.zip
	If the error box on the Arudino IDE says "A library named ArtBot already exists", start over from Step 1

Step 7: Now exit the Ardunio IDE completely and reopen (step 3)

Step 8: Go to File/Examples/ on the top menu. If you see ArtBot on the list, you have installed the library correctly!
